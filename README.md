Problems that your team ran into and how your team overcame them
	It was difficult to organize everything, especially how to store the data from the API searches. Everyone used tools that they werenâ€™t completely familiar with, some members used languages and libraries for the first time during this project, and tying together the frontend and backend are some of the many challenges the team faced throughout this hackathon. And most importantly, most members had never worked in a group environment on a coding project, so it was very much a new experience that took time to adjust to.
